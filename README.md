## Data Setup

The training and testing data are not included in this repository due to their size.

1.  **Download the dataset:** You can download the dataset from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19SiLQ1_Jx-NcvRF6eY4-kGv3-e-rweyO?usp=drive_link).
2.  **Unzip the files:** Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  **Place the data:** Place the `train1` and `test1` folders into the root directory of this project.

The final folder structure should look like this:

project-root/
├── train1/
│   ├── Sample001/
│   ├── Sample002/
│   └── ... (további minták)
├── .gitignore
